Instead of returning dict of poly1d instances, we should return nparray of
weights:

w = np.zeros(num_cells, N + 1)
{...}
w[i, :] = nonlinear_weights(...)

Then in the decon_recon() function, we need to change the way plotting is done
(need to import basis funcs here as well). 

This will be beneficial for the Discontinuous Galerkin step later.
